All about recent researches in NLP
Recent developments in NLP is a great leap. All we will learn here about Transformers

### What is a Transformer in NLP?

1. It's an Architecture to transform text from one sequence to another sequence(translate), Next Sentence Prediciton(NSP), Masked Language Modeling(MLM). 
2. It's similar to LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) architecture and has Encoder and Decoder
3. The role of Encoder is to take input and process through Embedding layers(Tokenization, finding close proximity words)
4. The role of Decoder is to obtain the Encoder Output as Input and decode (translate) to the required language
